### A <RedText>service worker (SW)</RedText> is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page
<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>SW is aslo <RedText>specification</RedText></li>
    <li>Ability to intercept and handle network requests, <RedText>network proxy</RedText></li>
    <li>Allows <RedText>new features that don't need a web page or user interaction</RedText>, like push notifications and background sync</li>
    <li>A service worker is <RedText>built into the browser</RedText> and controlled by a bit of extra JavaScript code that you are responsible for creating</li>
    <li>SW === <RedText>Web Worker</RedText>, non blocking, no DOM access</li>
    <li>Before service worker, there was one other API that gave users an offline experience on the web called <RedText>AppCache</RedText></li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>Web is build with premise that internet connection is always available, but that is not always the case</p>
  <p>
    A service worker is built into the browser and controlled by a bit of extra JavaScript code that you are responsible for creating.
    You deploy this alongside the other files that make up your actual web application.
  </p>
  <p>
    A service worker has some special powers‚Äîamong other duties, it patiently waits for your web app to make an outgoing request,
    and then springs into action by intercepting it. What the service worker does with this intercepted request is up to you!
    For some requests, the best course of action might be just to allow the request to continue on to the network,
    just like what would happen if there were no service worker at all.
    For other requests, though, you can take advantage of something more flexible than the browser's HTTP cache,
    and return a reliably fast response without having to worry about the network. That entails using the other piece of the puzzle: the Cache Storage API.
  </p>
  <p>Things to note about a service worker:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It's a Web Worker, so it can't access the DOM directly. Instead, a service worker can communicate with the pages it controls
      by responding to messages sent via the postMessage interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM if needed.
    </li>
    <li>Since it's Web Worker it is non blocking</li>
    <li>
      It's terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a
      service worker's onfetch and onmessage handlers. If there is information that you need to persist and reuse across restarts,
      service workers do have access to the IndexedDB API.
    </li>
    <li>Service workers are async, make extensive use of promises</li>
    <li>WebP example</li>
  </ul>

/>

<Notes>
  <ul>
    <li>If you don't include a scope in your manifest, then the default implied scope is the directory that your web app manifest is served from.</li>
    <li>The scope attribute can be a relative path (../), or any higher level path (/) which would allow for an increase in coverage of navigations in your web app.</li>
    <li>The start_url must be in the scope.</li>
    <li>The start_url is relative to the path defined in the scope attribute.</li>
    <li>A start_url starting with / will always be the root of the origin.</li>
    <li>When your app first launches, it can take a moment for the browser to spin up, and the initial content to begin rendering. Instead of showing a white screen that may look to the user like the app is stall, Chrome will show a splash screen, until the first paint.</li>
    <li>Splash screen, browser will automatically create the splash screen from the manifest properties, including, name, background_color and icons. The background_color should be the same color as the load page, to provide a smooth transition from the splash screen to your app.</li>
  </ul>

## Cache API gives us complete control over cache
<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li><RedText>Complete control over cache</RedText>, instead of relying on a combination of HTTP headers and the browser's built-in heuristics</li>
    <li>It's still <RedText>recommended that you configure the Cache-Control headers</RedText> on your web server</li>
    <li> What can we do that was difficult or impossible with just HTTP cache:
      <ul>
        <li>Use a "refresh in the background" approach to cached content, known as <RedText>stale-while-revalidate.</RedText></li>
        <li>Impose a cap on the maximum number of assets to cache, and implement a <RedText>custom expiration policy</RedText> to remove items once that limit is reached.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><RedText>Request/response objects</RedText> are used as the unique keys/return value of cache</li>
    <li>There are <RedText>no automatic, built-in expiration</RedText> or freshness checks</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>The Cache-Control header on a given Response is effectively ignored when caching data.</p>
  <p>
    It's still recommended that you configure the Cache-Control headers on your web server,
    even when you know that you're using the Cache Storage API. You can usually get away with
    setting Cache-Control: no-cache for unversioned URLs, and/or Cache-Control: max-age=31536000 for URLs that contain versioning information, like hashes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Request objects are used as the unique keys when reading and writing to these caches.
    As a convenience, you can pass in a URL string like 'https://example.com/index.html' as the key instead of an actual Request object
  </p>
  <p>Response objects are used as the values in these caches.</p>
  <p>
    There are no automatic, built-in expiration or freshness checks, and once you store an item in the cache,
    it will persist until your code explicitly removes it (there are libraries to simplify cache maintenance)

### Lifecycle starts with - install
<ul>
  <li><RedText>Install</RedText>
  <ul>
    <li>The install event is the first event a service worker gets, and it only happens once.</li>
    <li>During the install step event you'll typically want to cache some static assets</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>
  Typically during the install step, you'll want to cache some static assets. If all the files are cached successfully,
  then the service worker becomes installed. If any of the files fail to download and cache, then the install step will
  fail and the service worker won't activate (i.e. won't be installed). If that happens, don't worry, it'll try again next time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first event a service worker gets is install. It's triggered as soon as the worker executes, and it's only called once per service worker.
    If you alter your service worker script the browser considers it a different service worker, and it'll get its own install event.
  </p>
  <p>
    The install event is your chance to cache everything you need before being able to control clients.
    The promise you pass to event.waitUntil() lets the browser know when your install completes, and if it was successful.
  </p>
</Notes>

---
### After installation, SW won't be activated immediately if there is already active SW
<ul>
  <li>Install</li>
  <li><RedText>Wait</RedText></li>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>Refresh is not enough to make new SW go from waiting phase to active, we need to close tab all tabs (existing SW should control zero clients)</p>
  <p>Without waiting we would break running app in another tab</p>
  <p>You can take control of uncontrolled clients by calling clients.claim() within your service worker once it's activated. Note: Lot of people
  including clients.claim() as boilerplate, but you should rarely do so. It only really matters on the very first load,
  and due to progressive enhancement the page is usually working happily without service worker anyway.</p>
  <p>For development purposes we can in Chrome Dev Tools enable Update on reload and we can click skipWaiting</p>
    <p>
    skipWaiting() means that your new service worker is likely controlling pages that were loaded with an older version.
    This means some of your page's fetches will have been handled by your old service worker, but your new service worker will be handling subsequent fetches.
    If this might break things, don't use skipWaiting()
  </p>
  <p>
    If your promise rejects, this signals the install failed, and the browser throws the service worker away.
  </p>
</Notes>

### When new SW is activated it is opportunity for handling of old caches
<ul>
  <li>Install</li>
  <li>Wait</li>
  <li><RedText>Active</RedText></li>
</ul>

<img src={swLifecycle} alt="Service worker lifecycle." height="550px"/>

<Notes>
  <p>When installed, the activation step will follow and this is a great opportunity for handling any management of old caches</p>
  <p>
    After the activation step, the service worker will control all pages that fall under its scope,
    though the page that registered the service worker for the first time won't be controlled until it's loaded again.
    Once a service worker is in control, it will be in one of two states: either the service worker will be terminated to save memory,
    or it will handle fetch and message events that occur when a network request or message is made from your page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once your service worker is ready to control clients and handle functional events like push and sync,
    you'll get an activate event. But that doesn't mean the page that called .register() will be controlled.
  </p>
  <p>Closing page termiantes active and waiting SW.</p>

## Updating SW
- To update SW we just need to change something in SW file

<Notes>
  <ul>
    <li>Update your service worker JavaScript file. When the user navigates to your site, the browser tries to redownload the script file</li>
      that defined the service worker in the background. If there is even a byte's difference in the service worker file compared to what it currently has, it considers it new.
    <li>Your new service worker will be started and the install event will be fired.</li>
  </ul>
</Notes>

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/basic-caching.snippet")}
  title="Basic caching"
  theme={vsDark}
/>
<Notes>
  <p>
    Here you can see we call caches.open() with our desired cache name, after which we call cache.addAll() and pass in our array of files.
    This is a chain of promises (caches.open() and cache.addAll()). The event.waitUntil() method takes a promise and uses it to know how long installation takes,
    and whether it succeeded or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    If all the files are successfully cached, then the service worker will be installed. If any of the files fail to download,
    then the install step will fail. This allows you to rely on having all the assets that you defined, but does mean you need
    to be careful with the list of files you decide to cache in the install step. Defining a long list of files will increase the
    chance that one file may fail to cache, leading to your service worker not getting installed. -> If just one file fails, sw won't be installed
  </p>
  <p>This is just one example, you can perform other tasks in the install event or avoid setting an install event listener altogether.</p>

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/cache-and-return-request.snippet")}
  title="Returning cached response"
  theme={vsDark}
/>
<Notes>
  <p>Now that you've installed a service worker, you probably want to return one of your cached responses, right?</p>
  <p>
    After a service worker is installed and the user navigates to a different page or refreshes,
    the service worker will begin to receive fetch events, an example of which is below.
  </p>
  <p>Here we've defined our fetch event and within event.respondWith(), we pass in a promise from caches.match(). This method looks at the request and finds any cached results from any of the caches your service worker created.</p>
  <p>
    If we have a matching response, we return the cached value, otherwise we return the result of a call to fetch,
    which will make a network request and return the data if anything can be retrieved from the network.
    This is a simple example and uses any cached assets we cached during the install step.
  </p>
</Notes>

## There are few caching strategies we can use

<ul>
  <li>Network-first</li>
  <li>Cache-first/Offline-first</li>
  <li>Stale-while-revalidate</li>
</ul>

<Notes>
As opposed to precaching (which always tries to serve a set of predefined files from a cache),
runtime caching can combine network and cache access in multiple ways. Each combination is generally
referred to as a caching strategy. Key caching strategies include:
- Network-first
- Cache-first
- Stale-while-revalidate
</Notes>

---
## Network-first
<img src={swNetworkFirst} alt="Network first cache strategy."/>

<Notes>
  <p>In this approach, your service worker first attempts to retrieve a response from the network.</p>
  <p>
    If the network request succeeds, great! The response is returned to your web app, and a copy of
    the response is stored using the Cache Storage API‚Äîeither creating a new entry, or updating a previous entry for the same URL.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the network request fails entirely, or takes too long to return a response,
    then the most recent response from the cache is returned instead.
  </p>
</Notes>
---
## Cache-first
<img src={swCacheFirst} alt="Cache first cache strategy"/>

<Notes>
  <p>
    A cache-first strategy is effectively the opposite of network-first. In this approach, when your service worker intercepts a request,
    it first uses the Cache Storage API to see whether there's a cached response available. If there is, that response is returned to the web app.
  </p>  
  <p>If there's a cache miss, though, then the service worker will go to the network and attempt to retrieve a response there.</p>
  <p>
    Assuming that network request is successful, it's returned to your web app and a copy is saved in a cache. This cached copy
    will be used to bypass the network the next time a request for the same URLs is made.
  </p>
  <p>Cache-first is usually used for versioned URLs</p>
</Notes>

---
## Stale while revalidate

<img src={swStaleWhileRevalidate} alt="Stale while revalidate cache strategy." />

<Notes>
  <p>
    Stale-while-revalidate is something of a hybrid. When using it, your service worker will immediately check for a cached response and,
    if one is found, pass it back to your web app.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the meantime, regardless of whether there was a cache match, your service worker also fires off a network request to get back a "fresh" response.
    This response is used to update any previously cached response.
    If the initial cache check was a miss, a copy of the network response is also passed back to your web app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Which of your assets should be cached, with which strategies?
    Runtime caching can be viewed as a complement to precaching. If all of your assets are already being precached,
    then you're done‚Äîthere's nothing that needs to be cached at runtime. Chances are, for any relatively complex web app,
    you're not going to be precaching everything though.
  </p>
  <p>
    Larger media files, assets that are served from a third-party host like a CDN, or API responses,
    are just a few examples of the types of assets that can't be effectively precached. Use the Network panel in DevTools
    to identify requests that fall into this category, and for each of them, think about what tradeoff of freshness vs. reliability is appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use stale-while-revalidate to prioritize reliability over freshness
    Since a stale-while-revalidate strategy returns a cached response almost immediately‚Äîafter the cache has been populated via the first
    request‚Äîyou'll end up seeing reliably fast performance when using this strategy. This comes with the tradeoff of getting back response data
    that could be stale in comparison to what would have been retrieved from the network. Using this strategy works best for assets like user profile
    images or the initial API responses used to populate a view, when you know that showing something immediately is key, even if it's an older value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use network-first to prioritize freshness over reliability
    In some sense, using a network-first strategy is admitting defeat in your battle against the network‚Äîit's given priority,
    but that brings with it uncertainty about reliability. For certain types of assets, seeing a fresh response is preferable to getting back stale information. You might prefer freshness when making an API request for the text of an article that is updated frequently, for instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using a network-first strategy inside of a service worker, instead of just going against the network directly,
    you have the benefit of being able to fall back to something, even if it's a potentially stale response. You won't be reliably fast,
    but at least you'll be resilient while offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use cache-first for versioned URLs
    In a cache-first strategy, once an entry is cached, it's never updated. For that reason,
    make sure that you only use it with assets that you know are unlikely to change. In particular,
    it works best for URLs that contain versioning information‚Äîthe same sort of URLs that should also be
    served with a Cache-Control: max-age=31536000 response header.
  </p>
